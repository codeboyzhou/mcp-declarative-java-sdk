/**
 * Exception thrown when an error occurs during MCP server component registration.
 *
 * <p>This exception is used to indicate failures that occur while attempting to register MCP server
 * components such as resources, prompts, tools, or completion handlers. Common scenarios where this
 * exception may be thrown include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Invalid method signatures for component handlers
 *   <li>Missing or incorrect annotations on component methods
 *   <li>Dependency injection failures during component creation
 *   <li>Configuration errors in component metadata
 *   <li>Reflection-related errors during component discovery
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This exception extends {@link McpServerException} and is part of the MCP declarative
 * framework's exception hierarchy, providing specific error information for component registration
 * failures while maintaining compatibility with the general MCP server exception handling.
