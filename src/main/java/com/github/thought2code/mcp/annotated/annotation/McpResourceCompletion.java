/**
 * Annotation for marking methods that provide completion functionality for MCP resources.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is used to identify methods that can handle completion requests for specific
 * resources in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. When applied to a method, it indicates that
 * the method can provide auto-completion suggestions for the specified resource URI.
 *
 * <p>Methods annotated with {@code @McpResourceCompletion} must:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Return {@link McpCompleteCompletion}
 *   <li>Accept exactly one parameter of type {@code McpSchema.CompleteRequest.CompleteArgument}
 *   <li>Be properly configured with a resource URI
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The annotation is retained at runtime and can only be applied to methods. Resource completion
 * is typically used to provide suggestions for resource identifiers, file paths, or other
 * resource-specific parameters.
